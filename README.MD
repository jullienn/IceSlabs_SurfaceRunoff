# Ice slabs thickening drives surface runoff expansion from the Greenland Ice Sheet’s percolation zone

## Introduction

All the codes used for data preparation, processing, analysis and figure generation are present in this folder.
These codes were written by Nicolas Jullien between 2022 and 2023.
The way the codes and folders are now organized in this code repository were not tested, and some parts may fail. Furthermore, path adaptations are mandatory before running any code.
Some codes (that we may or may not have modified) were directly taken from MacFerrin et al., (2019), and Jullien et al., (2023). Some sections in other codes use functions developped by MacFerrin et al., (2019), some others, and Jullien et al., (2023) that may or not have been modified by us.
Feel free to contact the author for any questions (nicolas.jullien@unifr.ch).

The datasets used in this paper, as well as exported data are archived in the data repository related to the paper, accessible at https://zenodo.org/records/10376906
